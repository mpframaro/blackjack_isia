# Reinforcement Agent for Blackjack

This project was done for a third year curricular unit (Introdução a Sistemas Inteligentes e Autónomos).

With Gymnasium Toy Text Blackjack environment as base, I made changes that allow for a better training of reinforcement learning agents.
Then, for different algorithms used on both the original and modified environment, I trained said agents and compared the results, using TensorFlow and Stable Baselines 3.
